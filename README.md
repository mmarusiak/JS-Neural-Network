# JS Neural Network

Simple neural network made step by step with Shiffman's [nature of code series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ7HLz9VYz0&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aCibgK1PTWWu9by6XFdCfh). All stuff was implemented and made by me, but I created them with huge help of Shiffman's series.

### XOR demo

*Demo made with help of [18th episode of the series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlqinMNM4xs&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aCibgK1PTWWu9by6XFdCfh&index=18).*

### Color predictor demo

*Demo inspired by [one of the coding train episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtPpoMThKUs). I've made this demo from start to finish by myself - without watching Shiffman's implementation during that process, also I've added color bar at the middle, which indicates "percentage" of predict for each one.*

At the end I wanted to appreciate Shiffman's work and maybe convince you to try to do some of [coding challanges or courses](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain) for yourself.
