# JS Neural Network

Simple neural network made step by step with Shiffman's [nature of code series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ7HLz9VYz0&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aCibgK1PTWWu9by6XFdCfh). All stuff was implemented and made by me, but I created them with huge help of Shiffman's series.

Here is my simple demo-test thingy:

I'm still not exactly sure if my library is 100% working as expected, because from time to time it can give some weird output, so I'll need to test it in some other demos.
